What Single-Cell Data is Teaching us about Cancer Evolution
2. Introduction:

Cancer is a complex, dynamic process driven by genetic and non-genetic alterations, which confer on tumor cells an ability to adapt and survive under selective conditions, a proliferative advantage, immune evasion, and treatment resistance (Ciriello et al., 2024). Based on Darwinian evolution, genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as interactions with the tumor microenvironment, give rise to a variety of subclonal populations that compete and cooperate (Ashouri et al., 2023). The consequences are tumor heterogeneity, resistance to therapies, and disease relapse. Interestingly, the sequencing of genomes suggests that the majority of tumors follow branching, neutral, or punctuated models of evolution, rather than a linear succession (Somarelli et al., 2020). For example, the Big Bang model in colorectal cancer refers to early, massive clonal diversification without strong subsequent selection, thus explaining the coexistence of subclones and patterns of resistance (Sottoriva et al., 2015). Similarly, prostate cancer shows spatially intermixed, branching evolution with polyclonal seeding of metastases, whereby different subclones independently seed separate lesions, complicating treatment due to the heterogeneous nature of resistance mechanisms (Woodcock et al., 2020).
Bulk sequencing has been instrumental in the study of tumors, but has several key limitations-it averages signals from millions of cells, hiding rare but crucial subpopulations that might be driving therapy resistance and relapse (Alizadeh et al., 2015). Critical spatial information, such as cell-cell interactions and immune infiltration, is lost, which is integral to understanding both tumor behaviour and treatment response. Indeed, studies have documented that up to 90% of transcriptional and cell-type-specific information can be missed compared to single-cell techniques. Therefore, cancer research is increasingly shifting toward single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to obtain more accurate and clinically relevant insights (Wang et al., 2024).
Single-cell technologies have revolutionized cancer research by enabling the detailed analysis of individual cells' genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic features beyond the limitations of bulk sequencing (Liu et al., 2024). For example, methods such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, along with multi-omics platforms, can elucidate rare cell types and dynamic states and reveal regulatory pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis and/or therapeutic resistance. Insights into tumor hierarchies, biomarker discovery, and identification of key microenvironment interactions have thus been revealed (Chen et al., 2023). Clinically, single-cell approaches are guiding personalized treatments, monitoring residual disease, and identifying drug targets. For instance, trials such as NCT03561264 and NCT04185831 use single-cell profiling to improve immunotherapy response predictions and treatment planning, showcasing their increasing relevance in cancer care (Ianevski et al., 2024).
Single-cell data is important in cancer due to the critical insights it provides into cellular diversity, evolutionary dynamics, and functional states within tumors that cannot be resolved with bulk approaches (Hawsawi et al., 2024). Profiling single cells enables the identification of rare but clinically important subpopulations that include treatment-resistant clones, stem-like cancer cells, and distinct immune cell subsets; these have far-reaching implications for disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Wills & Mead, 2015). Single-cell analyses enable the detailed mapping of tumor heterogeneity, unravelling the complex cell-cell interactions, signaling pathways and spatial relationships that govern tumor growth, immune evasion, and metastatic potential (Molla Desta & Birhanu, 2025). Such information informs the discovery of novel biomarkers, guides the development of targeted therapies, and improves the effectiveness of personalized medicine in oncology, with the ultimate goal of improving patient prognosis and outcomes (Kuang et al., 2025). In this review, we discuss how emerging single-cell technologies are transforming our understanding of cancer evolution and treatment resistance, considering their impact on research and clinical practice.
